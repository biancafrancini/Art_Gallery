      `In a land where gods and mortals lived, 
Zeus, disguised as a traveler, met a kind old woman named Agatha. 
She offered him shelter and food, unaware of his true identity. 
Touched by her kindness, Zeus granted her a wish. 
Agatha wished to visit the heavens and see the stars up close. 
Zeus took her to the sky, and, moved by her joy, 
immortalized her as a beautiful new constellation. `,
